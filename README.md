##  Practical Work 1

1. Build a genealogical tree of your family using relations defining events in the human life – birth, death, marriage, divorce. Each event should marked by year like this: birth(huang_xiaoxi, male, 2002, wang_jian, yu_chuqiao). Arguments are: 1 – who is born, 2 – sex, 3 – year of birth, 4 – father, 5 – mother). You should write at least 20 records of birth. Similarly, define the facts of death, marriage and divorce.

2. Define the rules for states, spouse, parent, child, single, married, widowed, divorced. As these states are temporal (not existing always), these rules should be defined for a year. For instance, we could ask “Was wang_jian a father of somebody in 2001?”.

3. Write ate least 20rules defining relation uncle, aunt, brother, cousin, grandmother, etc.

4. Run the program and solve at least 20 goals.
